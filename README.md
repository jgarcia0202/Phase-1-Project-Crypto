# Phase-1-Project-Crypto
Project gives the user the current and up to date information on the cryptocurrency Bitcoin. The data that is given is the current time and date, the price of bitcoin, the market cap, and the change in crypto. The website uses two seperate apis, one to get the time and date, then the other is used to get all the information on crypto. The website has a welcome sign for the user for when they enter then it has a box set up for all the information. The box is used to bring attention to the user on where the important part of the website, for example like a highlighter being used to highlight important information. The colors used on the website are crypto friendly which were found on https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel. I have included a few little designs to the website to make it seem more interesting and to give the website more character such as bundle of dollars and the thumbs up. Near the buttom the user is asked on their thoughts on the market where the event listners are used. THe website used 4 seperate event listeners, 2 of them being mouseover events and the other 2 click events. The hover over events both turn the text of the button they hover over orange to let the user know that they are on it and are about to select it. The click evenets are similar but different reactions. When the bullish button is clicked the button turns green as to show positive thoughts on the market then the bullish button turns white with black texts as if disabled and not selected. When the bear button is clicked the button turns red to show negative thoughts on the market and the bullish button turns white with black text to also show that it is not selected. The click events are used to interchange with each other so the user is able to change their minds and select the other option. I wanted the transition not be able to leave both buttons selected which is why the other looks disabled. This website is used to give the user information on current crypto information and let the user vote on how they think the market is going.
